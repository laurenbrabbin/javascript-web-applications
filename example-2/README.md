## Challenge

You should not change the HTML file contents; you'll use JS to dynamically change the page.

Work through the following steps by updating the View class in view.js:

1. Implement a new method addParagraph on View â€” this method should dynamically create a new p element and store it in a variable.
2. Set this new element's content to the string 'This paragraph has been dynamically added by JavaScript! (or something else).
3. Append the element to the main container element.
In the main file, (index.js) call this new method on the existing View instance.
4. When opening the HTML page, you should now see this third paragraph being added after the two other ones.
